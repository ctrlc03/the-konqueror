# Team Server

This contains the source code and pre-compiled binary (it only compiles on Linux because of the SQLite library in use, I'll try and sort this out at some point) for the server.

# Instructions

`./linux_x64_server -i ip_address -p rest_api_port -P gRPC_port`

Run it with the **-h** flag to check all other options.
